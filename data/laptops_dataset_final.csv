Apple MacBook AIR Apple M2 - (8 GB/256 GB SSD/Mac OS Monterey)...,4.7,"15,210",900,5,Best in the market!,"The deep midnight color is striking and adds a touch of elegance. The viewing experience is truly remarkable, providing vivid and immersive visuals. It's suitable for standard video and photo editing tasks.
